Personal Tennis Scheduler

This repository differs from the Duval Tennis Scheduler 
in that it is intended for a single user and incorporates
multiple leagues and tennis activities.

Instead of automating the tennis league management (as in Duval), this
app assumes manual league management by the league moderator and manual
communication of play schedules.  This app then allows rapid data entry of 
the tennis schedule so that it can be displayed on a smart phone and 
interfaced with Home Assistant.
